I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Computer Science at <a href='https://www.ubc.ca/about/'>The University of British Columbia (UBC)</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/mkhasan/'>Dr. Khalad Hasan</a> (Director of <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Khalad-Hasan-Lab'> UBC-O HCI Lab</a> ) and <a href='https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/pirani/'> Prof. Pourang P.Irani</a> (Director of <a href='https://ovi.ok.ubc.ca/'> UBC-O OVI Lab</a>) since January 2025, I have been conducting research at the intersection of eXplainable AI (XAI) and eXtended Reality (XR).

My current research focuses on:
1. Investigating how explainable AI can enhance human understanding and trust in XR-based decision-making environments.
2. Exploring interaction techniques for delivering explanations in immersive spaces.
3. Studying how users collaborate with AI systems in XR and how explanation affects such collaboration.

I also serve as a <a href='https://digital-transparency.ok.ubc.ca/research-team/our-research-assistants/iverson-schuchen-yuan/'> Research Assistant</a> at UBC’s <a href='https://research.ok.ubc.ca/research-excellence/research-clusters/digital-transparency/'> Digital Transparency Cluster (DTC)</a>,, where I contribute to a systematic review on trustworthiness in AI and related fields.

Previously, I worked closely with Prof. Haining Liang (HKUST) on upper-limb rehabilitation in Virtual Reality (VR), advised by Dr. Vijayakumar Nanjappan (University College Cork), and co-developed a high-precision Augmented Reality (AR) keyboard using the motion capture system “VICON.” 

I led an independent research project designing and evaluating an AR-based fitness assistant for obese individuals using Microsoft HoloLens 2, which received ¥2,000 in research funding and was presented at the XJTLU Student Research-led Learning Symposium.

I also collaborated with Dr. Jianjun Chen on machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in logistics, supported by a ¥6,000 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at XJTLU. I was awarded the University Academic Achievement Award (Top 10% scholarship) and graduated in July 2024 with a First-Class Distinction (Major GPA 3.95) from the University of Liverpool (via XJTLU's dual-degree program).

I am currently a Teaching Assistant at UBC for the course *COSC 328 - Introduction to Networking*, where I assist with grading, tutorials, and student support.

Previously, I served as a TA for *CPT203 - Software Engineering I* at XJTLU, supporting over 300 undergraduate students through 80+ hours of tutoring and leading weekly Q&A sessions as part of a peer-led Mutual Aid Association. I also worked as a one-on-one tutor for students retaking core CS modules, delivering 70+ hours of personalized instruction that helped both students successfully pass their courses.
