# **I am**
**Currently** pursuing an **M.Sc. in Computer Science** at <a href='https://www.ubc.ca/about/'>The University of British Columbia (UBC)</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/mkhasan/'>Dr. Khalad Hasan</a> (Director of <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Khalad-Hasan-Lab'> UBC-O HCI Lab</a> ) and <a href='https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/pirani/'> Prof. Pourang P. Irani</a> (Director of <a href='https://ovi.ok.ubc.ca/'> UBC-O OVI Lab</a>) since **January 2025**. I am conducting research at the intersection of **eXplainable AI (XAI)** and **eXtended Reality (XR)**.

**My CURRENT research focuses on:**
1. Investigating how XAI can enhance human understanding and trust in XR-based decision-making environments.
2. Exploring interaction techniques for delivering explanations in immersive spaces.
3. Studying how users collaborate with AI systems in XR and how explanation affects such collaboration.

I also serve as a <a href='https://digital-transparency.ok.ubc.ca/research-team/our-research-assistants/iverson-shuchen-yuan/'> **Research Assistant (RA)**</a> in<a href='https://research.ok.ubc.ca/research-excellence/research-clusters/digital-transparency/'> Digital Transparency Cluster (DTC)</a> **@ UBC**, where I am focusing on **trustworthiness in AI**.

I am currently a **Teaching Assistant (TA) @ UBC** for the course ***COSC 328 - Introduction to Networking*** **@ UBC** working with <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott-Fazackerley-2'> Dr. Scott Fazackerley</a>, where I am providing support for **Python and Commputer Network Conception**. I am also a **TA** in course ***COSC 121 - Computer Programmmin II*** **@ UBC** with Dr. Scott where I am mainly responsible for final exam marking suppot for **Java programming**. 
<!-- and basic programming concepts. -->

# **I was**
